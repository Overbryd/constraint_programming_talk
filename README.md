Held at @[Ruby User Group Berlin](https://berlin.onruby.de/) on the 5th of January 2017.

In this repository you find the slides to the talk and the simple backtracking examples I prepared for the talk.

It also vendors the famous [**amb** implementation from Jim Weirich for Ruby Quiz 70](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz70.html).
